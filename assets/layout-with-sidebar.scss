   This file defines a layout that is as follows:
   
    - Sidebar
    
       - Site logo
       
       - Site navigation
       
       - Page navigation (i.e. table of contents)
    
    - Main content area
    
       - Header
       
       - Page
       
   The page navigation is sticky: as you scroll, it will follow you down, but it will never 
   move above its original position (to overlap the site navigation). Moreover, if it is 
   too large to fit on screen all at once, it will not begin "following" the user until they 
   have scrolled down enough to see its bottom.
   
   When viewed on mobile, the layout changes as follows:
   
    - The site logo and site navigation are placed into a topbar.
    
    - The page navigation is hidden entirely.

//
// Desktop-only styles.
//
// The plan was to put these in a media query which was the negation of the 
// smartphones-only media query. Unfortunately, however, Ruby Sass doesn't 
// fully support media queries:
//
//  - Only Dart Sass supports applying the `not` keyword to individual media 
//    features.
//
//  - Ruby Sass attempts to merge nested media queries. However, it doesn't 
//    do so reliably and it most certainly doesn't do so accurately: the 
//    `not` keyword is ignored when considering possible merges, and it'll 
//    be stripped out when performing them.
//
//    This means that even if we accept the constraint that `not` can only 
//    appear at the beginning of a query, to nullify it, Sass doesn't even 
//    consider that when choosing merges: (not a and not b and c) will be 
//    merged into (a and b and c), for example.
//
//  - The merge step happens after media queries have been serialized. This 
//    means that while interpolation e.g. `@media #{foo}` will allow you to 
//    sneak things past the parser when it otherwise wouldn't understand 
//    them, you CANNOT sneak past the broken query merging. In fact, if you 
//    write a query like `@media #{"not abc"}`, it gets merged to form the 
//    invalid query `@media not`. Just incredible.
//
// It's strange that Sass has a "breaking changes" page about their support 
// for Media Queries Level 4 as if they ever even fully supported Level 3.
