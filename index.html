   <h1>About me</h1>
   <p>
      I'm a self-taught C++ programmer with experience in some scripting languages 
      including Lua. I've published a variety of modifications and tools for major 
      video games, including <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> and <i>Halo: Reach</i>. 
      Many of my works have relied on knowledge gained through software reverse-engineering, 
      particularly x86 and x64 disassembly.

   <p>
      DovahKit is a third-party content editor for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, 
      intended as a fully-featured replacement for the official "Creation Kit" tools. 
      Planned features include: the ability to edit all high-importance game data types; 
      an embedded Lua script interpreter with APIs for working with game data, and APIs 
      for creating custom dialogs and UI; and a 3D renderer for editing the game world.
   </p>
   <p>
      The Creation Kit loads all game data in full, and its load times are typically 
      measurable in minutes. DovahKit, by contrast, uses a multi-threaded process to 
      scan and index game files, so that data objects can be loaded only on demand and 
      memory usage can be kept low. It takes fewer than ten seconds for DovahKit to 
      scan <i>Skyrim</i>'s game data and be ready for editing.
   </p>
   <p>
      DovahKit is programmed in C++ using the Qt UI framework. As of August 2021, it has 
      been in development for a year.

   <h3>ReachVariantTool (2020)</h3>

Minesweeper is here recreated in a first-person shooter game, with a 9x9 board constructed in the game's map editor; players can uncover board spaces by shooting them with a pistol, or toggle flags on board spaces by shooting them with a rifle, as the video demonstrates. Shooting a space that has a mine under it will reveal all mines, and then spawn ten to twenty more around the player-character, before detonating all of them. "

   <p>
      ReachVariantTool is a third-party editor for <i>Halo: Reach</i> multiplayer game modes. 
      It can be used to edit all game options normally accessible in-game as well as several 
      that are ordinarily hidden from players. It can also be used to edit the script code 
      for a multiplayer game mode, allowing the creation of entirely new modes and rules. The 
      first published proofs of concept included a fully functional recreation of Minesweeper 
      in <i>Halo: Reach</i>.
   </p>
   <p>
      ReachVariantTool is programmed in C++ using the Qt UI framework. Though much of the 
      data it works with had already been decoded by the community, I personally decoded 
      the settings format for "Firefight," <i>Halo: Reach</i>'s cooperative PvE mode, by 
      disassembling the game.
   </p>
   <p>
      Work on ReachVariantTool began in mid-December 2019. The program was released at the 
      start of January 2020 without the ability to edit script code. After seven months of 
      further work, the script editor was fully implemented and released in July 2020.

   <h3>ItemTrig (2019)</h3>

   </aside>
   <p>
      ItemTrig is an add-on for <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i> which allows users to automate a 
      variety of inventory management tasks. Players can create "triggers," each consisting 
      of a list of "conditions" to check and a list of "actions" to take if all conditions 
      are met. Conditions and actions are fill-in-the-blank phrases, and by combining them, 
      players have a great deal of flexibility in controlling how in-game items and loot are 
      managed.
   </p>
   <p>
      Like all <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i> add-ons, ItemTrig is coded in Lua, with its menus 
      and dialogs defined using both Lua and a game-specific XML dialect.
   </p>
   <p>
      ItemTrig's initial development took two to three months.

   <h3>NorthernUI (2018)</h3>

   </aside>
   <p>
      NorthernUI is a user interface and input mod for <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>. 
      It reskins the game's menus and dialogs to resemble those of its sequel, <i>Skyrim</i>, 
      and also adds Xbox controller support to the game's PC version for both menu operation 
      and general gameplay.
   </p>
   <p>
      NorthernUI relies heavily on a custom DLL injected using a community-made DLL loader. 
      This DLL is written in C++ but uses handwritten x86 assembly to patch and tamper with 
      <i>Oblivion</i>'s engine code, to improve user interface behaviors and to implement 
      Xbox controller support via XInput. NorthernUI also features a significant amount of 
      graphical work: Bethesda Softworks, the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> developers, do not allow 
      porting their assets between games, and <i>Oblivion</i> and <i>Skyrim</i> use different 
      formats anyway (rasters versus vectors), so NorthernUI features <i>Skyrim</i> look-alike 
      graphics drawn by hand, pixel by pixel.
   </p>
   <p>
      NorthernUI's initial development and release took approximately eight months, spanning 
      from September 2017 to its public debut in May 2018.

   <p>
      Cobb Positioner is an in-game map editor for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, 
      allowing players to reposition scenery and manipulate the game's environments 
      during play. The editor consists of a custom DLL coded in C++, alongside content 
      created using the game's proprietary scripting language, Papyrus. The DLL relies 
      on a community-made DLL loader, and is used to offer both game engine hooks and 
      faster implementations of rotation math and other complex operations.
   </p>
   <p>
      Cobb Positioner can be combined with Atronach Crossing, an additional <i>Skyrim</i> 
      mod which allows players to place houses and decorations into the game world. These 
      two mods were originally developed as a unified pair, with initial development 
      beginning no later than July 2014. Cobb Positioner was released in April 2016, while 
      Atronach Crossing was released in September 2016.

   <h3>Cobb Bug Fixes (2019 - 2020)</h3>
   <p>
      A custom DLL capable of patching <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> in memory and 
      fixing a variety of relatively small issues in the game engine. Issues fixed include 
      bugs in ranged combat, graphical and audio issues, and a "softlock" that can actively 
      prevent players with vampire characters from progressing further in the game.

   <h3>Cobb Encumbrance (2015; rebuilt in 2018)</h3>
   <p>
      A mod for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> which uses a clever workaround to alter 
      the player's stats based on how many items they're carrying. If a script in <i>Skyrim</i> 
      reacts directly to items being removed from the player's inventory, the script can end 
      up overburdening the game's script engine; instead, Cobb Encumbrance reacts to the 
      player closing any menu that allows them to potentially use, drop, or destroy items.

   <h3>ESO Death and Resurrection (2018)</h3>
   <p>
      A custom DLL and associated files for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, designed to 
      implement the death and respawn systems from <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i>. Players who 
      die in-game are able to respawn elsewhere, or to temporarily become a ghost and escape 
      the area, instead of having to reload a previous save file.
   </p>
   <p>
      This project required relatively in-depth reverse-engineering of how <i>Skyrim</i> 
      handles not only character deaths, but also stealth mechanics and AI detection. The 
      player's death needed to be intercepted, and ghostly players needed to be made totally 
      imperceptible to all non-playable characters.

   <h3>Skyrim Outfit System (2019)</h3>
   <p>
      A custom DLL and associated files for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> which allows 
      players to separate their equipped armor from their visible appearance: players can 
      dress their characters however they like, visually, while still being able to wear 
      powerful armor "underneath."
