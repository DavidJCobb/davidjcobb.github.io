///   remove-unit
///
///      Sass can only divide unitless numbers. Use this function to aid with division.
///
///      To be specific: at some point in its lifespan, Sass was ported from Ruby to Dart, 
///      and the Ruby version is abandonware. GitHub Pages runs on Jekyll, which is built 
///      in Ruby (and is itself abandonware due to the death of its developer).
///
///      As of this writing, all versions of Sass support dividing numbers by writing a 
///      slash between them: $a / $b. However, if those numbers have units, then Sass will 
///      not perform a division; it will print #{$a} / #{$b}. This is because CSS itself 
///      uses the slash symbol for its own purposes.
///
///      Post-Ruby versions of Sass offer `math.div($a, $b)` as an alternative, but that 
///      was never backported to Ruby Sass. Even if it had been, Jekyll wouldn't have 
///      adopted it, for obvious reasons.
